spoiler: New Years Resolutions

Here's my New Years Resolutions for 2020:

1. Travel a lot
2. Get in shape
3. Invest more
4. Blog?

**\#1** is already prepared. I leave Friday for Turkey and I have plans for a cross-European race in August and the Danakil Depression in November. I'm trying to come up with a way to visit at least 15 countries in 2020 to improve chances of getting all 195 by 2029.

**\#2** will take discipline. I have none. This is probably the most common New Year's Resolution available.

**\#3** will take studying, which takes discipline, but I enjoy doing it so it's easier.

**\#4** might be fun, I'll post this to no one and see how I feel about it.

In other news, I decided to start moving things entirely off Google. I'm still fairly upset with them over cancelling the Works with Nest program. So today, I ordered an Ecobee to replace my Nest, and transferred all my email to a new Fastmail account.

No need to change search engines as I've been using DuckDuckGo for years.

I've started converting various accounts over to my new email (`dylan@dylan.is`). I even migrated my github account off my silly old name (`meinhimmel` -> `dylanarmstrong`). That will take some getting used to. To avoid having someone else take it, I created a redirecting account at my old name.

Also, I have 8 stars on my `tampermonkey-scripts` repo. Nifty.
